# Engineering Enlightenment

Every significant technology advancement is an opportunity to use the wisdom and understanding we gained from the advancements that came before. We can revisit, reevaluate, and re-balance. To make this possible, newly emerging advancements need to be shepherded as they are completed, refined, and finally released.

Engineering Enlightenment is an interface between newly arriving technologies and the world. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which fosters and protects high impact knowledge and discoveries until they can be safely and equitably introduced to the general public.

Engineering Enlightenment operates entirely on donations, and all donated resources are used to conduct research, develop technologies and knowledge, and to protect and safely disseminate completed works.
